# School-Project-E-commerce
Barcode weighing scale in Python using custom tkinter (Student 2 and 3 conbined)

# Main Objective
The main objective of this project is to a create service that will allow customers to order groceries online on a website and after go to the store to have their shopping loaded into the trunk of their cars, by a store employee. 

# Scenario
The customer should be able to place their orders through a website. The order is received by the order preparer who then retrieves the products. For perishable products such as fruits and vegetables, they need to be weighed and labeled with a barcode for all items, which are then given to the invoice manager to create a bill. An operator will scan the barcode of all products using a barcode scanner, thus updating the database on inventory management and generating the invoice for the final consumer.

Finally, the payment operator will package the products for the customer and update the payment terminal so that the customer can pay.
