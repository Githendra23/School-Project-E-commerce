# Main Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a service that enables customers to place grocery orders online via a website and then have a store employee load their purchases into the trunk of their vehicles upon arrival at the store. 

# Scenario
The customer should be able to place their orders through a website. The order is received by the order preparer who then retrieves the products. For perishable products such as fruits and vegetables, they need to be weighed and labeled with a barcode for all items, which are then given to the invoice manager to create a bill. An operator will scan the barcode of all products using a barcode scanner, thus updating the database on inventory management and generating the invoice for the final consumer.

Finally, the payment operator will package the products for the customer and update the payment terminal so that the customer can pay.
